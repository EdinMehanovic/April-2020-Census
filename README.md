# April-2020-Census
## Description
#### This program runs code in which it scours a specific url that is written into the code. Loading the offical population number of the 50 states for April 1, 2020 via the Census. When running the program, there is a loading screen showcasing how many of the 50 states you have loaded up (an example of this is on 'Output1.PNG). The program itself takes some time to fully display the final output, so if you wish to bypass this simply view 'Output2.PNG' on this repository. 
## How to View
#### Sign into GitHub and run a codespace on the repository, then select 'AssignmentFLEM.py' and run the code to be able to interact with the program. If you are not able to sign-in, then simply look over to both 'Output1.PNG' and 'Output2.PNG' to see an example of what the program outputs.
